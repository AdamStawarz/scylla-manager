Remove a Node/Datacenter from Scylla Manager
--------------------------------------------

There is no need to perform any action in Scylla Manager after removing a node or datacenter from a Scylla cluster.

.. note:: If you are removing the cluster from Scylla Manager and you are using Scylla Monitoring,
   refer to `targets example <http://scylladb.github.io/scylla-monitoring/master/monitoring_stack.html#configure-scylla-nodes-from-files>`_ for more information.
