# Cloud testing tools

This package provides tools to work with cloud lab and other scylla RHEL installations.
It is built with [sup - Simple Deployment Tool](https://pressly.github.io/sup/).

# Getting Started

1. Go to https://front.lab.dbaas.scyop.net/ and create a cluster
1. Go to AWS console for Cloud Lab:
  - For every VM in your cluster add tags Key: `keep` Value: `alive` to prevent from garbage collecting your cluster after 2h
  - Take any VM in your cluster and edit the first Security Group by enabling SSH access from your machine
1. Get [Lab support pem file](https://github.com/scylladb/siren-devops/blob/master/cluster/maintenance/access/lab/support.pem) and save it as `~/.ssh/id_scylla-lab-support.pem`, the `id_` prefix is mandatory for `sup` to automatically load it

## Working with ssh-agent

If you dislike the `id_` prefix or would like to keep the key elsewhere you can work with `ssh-agent` to load the key.

Example:

```bash
$ eval `ssh-agent`
Agent pid 16210
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/scylla-lab-support.pem 
Identity added: /home/michal/.ssh/scylla-lab-support.pem (/home/michal/.ssh/scylla-lab-support.pem)
```

*WARNING* do not forget to kill the agent when you are done.

# Scylla Manager Installation

When you have a cluster up and running and you can SSH to any node, it's time to cook the `sup`.

## Register nodes in networks

1. Put all IPs of node VMs (name like `Scylla-Cloud-...-Node-X`) in `networks/agent.hosts` each in a new line, don't forget to add `support@` user prefix to IP
1. Put IP of monitor node (name like `Scylla-Cloud-...-Monitor`) in `networks/server.host`, don't forget to add `support@` user prefix to IP.

## Let the knife do the sup

1. Run `sup agent install start`
1. Run `sup server install`
1. Go to server edit config file `/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml` db section to use the created cluster (FIXME waiting for a volunteer to fix that step)
1. Run `sup server start`

# Updating binaries to your local dev builds

1. Build agent or server binaries with `make dev-agent` or `make dev-server` in the root of the project
1. Run `sup agent update` or `sup server update` this will upload dev binary and restart service
